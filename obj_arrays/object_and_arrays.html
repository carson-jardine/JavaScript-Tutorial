    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2)
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2)
    //
    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'poop';
    // this replaces 'poppy' in the original array

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // if you pass slice nothing, it copies the original arry

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'blah';

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'meow';
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wes',
        facebook: 'wesweswes'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    // ^^ not the best way to do deep cloning but you can avoid editing the original const with this. bc if you were to do dev.social.twitter = '@coolcool', it would also update wes but if you do update dev2, it will only update dev2 and nothing else
